# JustAI-chatbot-Bulls-and-cows
A JustAI chatbot that plays Bulls and Cows.
The bot was developed using Just AI's JAICP environment (https://app.jaicp.com/).
Some of ther pre-designed states and responses from offtopic were used to provide extra conversational capacity for the bot 
(mostly catching and deflecting questions it isn't meant to answer, etc.). The dependency "Patterns" was also added.
The platform uses JAICP DSL for the script and JavaScript to describe business logic and integrate with external systems.
JAICP's "Patterns" are used as a kind of simplified regex to describe user input (triggers), 
e.g. * {(how [many|much]) (gamer*|player*|people) [can] [play]} *
The point of this bot is to play Bulls and Cows, there are no extra features.
